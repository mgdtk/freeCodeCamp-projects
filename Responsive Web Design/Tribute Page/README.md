# Tribute Page

This is the second of five certification projects for the **freeCodeCamp** **Responsive Web Design** course.

## 📌 Description

The goal of this project is to build a **tribute page** for a subject, fictional or real, following freeCodeCamp User Stories and passing all required tests on the platform. It's an opportunity to enhance the page's responsiveness and explore different CSS and HTML features.

I chose to pay tribute to **Wanda Maximoff**, also known as the Scarlet Witch, a fictional character from the Marvel Comics. While building this page, I learned new ways to style images and deepened my understanding of CSS pseudo-classes, learning how to apply them in a more polished and consistent way. I also improved my ability to build layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
