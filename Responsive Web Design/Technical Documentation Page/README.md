# Technical Documentation Page

This is the third of five certification projects for the **freeCodeCamp** **Responsive Web Design** course.

## 📌 Description

The goal of this project is to build a **technical documentation page** to serve as instruction or reference for a topic, following freeCodeCamp User Stories and passing all required tests on the platform. It emphasizes responsive layout design, semantic HTML, and clean navigation structure.

To build the page, I chose a topic I am already familiar with: the basics of the Python programming language. I created a simple technical documentation page to cover its core concepts. While working on it, among other things, I learned how to make the layout responsive on different devices and how to use the `@media` query in CSS.
